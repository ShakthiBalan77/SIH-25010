## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Proposed Solution
A mobile-first, multilingual platform that delivers personalized and location-based agricultural recommendations powered by AI/ML models. It will integrate soil health data, weather forecasts, crop disease predictions, and market price analytics to provide farmers with actionable insights. The platform will support image-based pest/disease identification, and voice interaction in regional languages to ensure accessibility for low-literate users. The system will also gather farmer feedback for continuous improvement and personalization.

Technical Approach
The solution will use mobile application development frameworks such as Flutter/React Native for cross-platform deployment. Backend services will be managed with Node.js/Django and integrated with cloud services like AWS or Azure for scalability. Machine learning models (TensorFlow/PyTorch) will be trained on crop, soil, and pest datasets to deliver recommendations. A chatbot powered by NLP will provide an interactive advisory system. The solution will incorporate APIs for weather data, soil testing kits, and government market price databases. Field testing with a working prototype will validate performance before scaling.

Feasibility and Viability
The idea is feasible due to high smartphone penetration among rural farmers and government initiatives promoting digital agriculture. Challenges such as connectivity issues, language diversity, and limited digital literacy will be mitigated through offline sync, multilingual AI translation, and intuitive voice-based interactions. Collaborations with agricultural universities and government extension officers will provide domain validation and data accuracy. The business model can involve government subsidies, partnerships with agri-tech firms, and freemium farmer subscriptions.

Impact and Benefits
Social: Empowers farmers with access to trusted scientific knowledge in their local language.

Economic: Increases crop yield, reduces input cost, and stabilizes farmer income.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable agriculture practices, prevents overuse of fertilizers and chemicals, and conserves resources.

Policy Support: Enhances effectiveness of agricultural extension programs and aligns with national food security goals.
